[Elements of Programming Style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elements_of_Programming_Style)
[B. W. Kernighan and P. J. Plauger, The Elements of Programming Style 2nd Edition, McGraw Hill, New York, 1978. ISBN 0-07-034207-5](https://www.gettextbooks.com/isbn/9780070342071/)

The year was 1919, the first World War was at its close and a student, E. B. White, took a course, English 8, taught by William Strunk Jr.  The course featured a required textbook, a slim volume called **The Elements of Style**.  The durability of this slim book informed the development of the book, **The Elements of Programming Style** by Kernigan and Plauger,  whose lessons we adapt here in this course. Showing again the durability of the approach of beginning with philosophy as one approaches their work and use of programs and structure to achieve their work.

So with this nod to E.B. White, William Strunk, Jr, Brian Kernigan and Plauger, we begin with our own Lessons and Pithy Phrases.

### Lessons **`Translated to the Workflow/Containerized Process`** (Truncated Pithy Phrases)

Where I have made modifications to these `Pithy Phrases` to the map to what we are teaching here *`will be in italicized and emphasized`*

Its lessons are summarized at the end of each section in pithy maxims, such as "Let the machine do the dirty work":

**Shortened Lessons Learned**

**1.** Write clearly â€“ don't be too clever. *`timeless`* **Full List Number - 1.**
**2.** Write first in easy-to-understand pseudo language; then translate into whatever language you have to use. *`timeless`* **Full List Number - 13.**
**3.** Modularize. Use procedures and functions. *`and containerize - use GitHub Actions to build, test and keep up-to-date`* **Full List Number - 14.**
**4.** Write and test a big program in small pieces. *`timeless this can be done by the use of these tested, dockerized processes`* **Full List Number - 17.**
**5.** Test input for plausibility and validity. *`timeless - make sure you understand the source of your data`* **Full List Number - 19.**
**6.** Use debugging compilers. *`timeless this is different with workflow languages - you can test each of the steps in the workflow verifying inputs, outputs and processes - dockerizing, testing `* **Full List Number 29.**
**7.** Make it right before you make it faster. *`timeless for everything`* **Full List Number 29.**
**8.** Make sure special cases are truly special. *`timeless`* **Full List Number 35.**
**9.** Keep it simple to make it faster. *`timeless`* **Full List Number 36.**
**10.** Document your data layouts. *`timeless`* **Full List Number 45.**
