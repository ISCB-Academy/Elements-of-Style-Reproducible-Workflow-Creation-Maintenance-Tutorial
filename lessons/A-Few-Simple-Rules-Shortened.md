[Elements of Programming Style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elements_of_Programming_Style)
[B. W. Kernighan and P. J. Plauger, The Elements of Programming Style 2nd Edition, McGraw Hill, New York, 1978. ISBN 0-07-034207-5](https://www.gettextbooks.com/isbn/9780070342071/)

The year was 1919, the first World War was at its close and a student, E. B. White, took a course, English 8, taught by William Strunk Jr.  The course featured a required textbook, a slim volume called **The Elements of Style**.  The durability of this slim book informed the development of the book, **The Elements of Programming Style** by Kernigan and Plauger,  whose lessons we adapt here in this course. Showing again the durability of the approach of beginning with philosophy as one approaches their work and use of programs and structure to achieve their work.

So with this nod to E.B. White, William Strunk, Jr, Brian Kernigan and Plauger, we begin with our own Lessons and Pithy Phrases.

### Lessons **`Translated to the Workflow/Containerized Process`** (Truncated Pithy Phrases)

Where I have made modifications to these `Pithy Phrases` to the map to what we are teaching here *`will be in italicized and emphasized`*

Its lessons are summarized at the end of each section in pithy maxims, such as "Let the machine do the dirty work":

| Number | Lesson | Relates Too | Full Lessons Number |
| 1.     | Write clearly â€“ don't be too clever.| Everything | [1.](https://github.com/ISCB-Academy/Elements-of-Style-Reproducible-Workflow-Creation-Maintenance-Tutorial/blob/main/lessons/A-Few-Simple-Rules.md) |
| 2.     | Write first in easy-to-understand pseudo language; then translate into whatever language you have to use. | Everything | 13. |
| 3.     | Modularize. Use procedures and functions. | Containerizing with Dockerfile | 14. |
| 4.     | Write and test a big program in small pieces. | Containerizing with Dockerfile, GitHub Actions to test and deposit upon every change to Dockerfile| 17.|
| 5.     | Test input for plausibility and validity. | GitHub Actions to test each step in a workflow allows input testing | 19.|
| 6.     | Use debugging compilers. | Use platform as a service, pull straight from version in GitHub and our Compiler is the Use of Workflows | 29. |
| 7.     | Make it right before you make it faster. | Everything | 29. |

8. Make sure special cases are truly special. *`timeless`* **Full List Number 35.**
